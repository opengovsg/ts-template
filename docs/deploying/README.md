# Deploying Your Application

This section of the documentation contains guides to deploy your 
application to a production environment, ready to receive users.

- [For Everyone](./for-everyone.md): use DigitalOcean. Read this
  if you do not have an engineering background, have no engineers 
  on your team, and have some time and access to a credit card.

- [For Engineers](./for-engineers.md): use AWS Elastic Container
  Service. Read this if you are an engineer (or if you are bold!).

- For Hustlers (coming soon!): use fly.io. Read this if you want to 
  launch without any engineering, time or financial resources.

## Post-deployment

- [Going Public](./going-public.md): deploying to a cloud platform is 
  just the beginning. Read this to know of the other things one has to 
  do so that a product can be made available to the public.
