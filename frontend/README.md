# OGP React Starter Kit

Frontend repository for Open Government Product's Starter Kit template, bootstrapped with `Create React App` (with modifications).

> üìù: The goal of this template is not to support or transform existing apps, but hopefully serve as a collection of resources and best practices. The repository will (hopefully) provide a good jumping off point and be a solid foundation for starting new projects.
